In modern fundamental plant research, scientists produce high-dimensional polymorphic data. To facilitate the collection, processing, exchange, and archiving of these data, the DataPLANT consortium within the [NFDI](https://www.nfdi.de) drives digital transformation and democratization of research data in the field of basic plant research.

DataPLANT is well prepared for the upcoming challenges by combining expertise in the areas of basic plant research, information and computer sciences, and infrastructure. The targeted service landscape consists of technical-digital assistance as well as personnel on-site support, since the consortium was entirely designed to be user centric.
