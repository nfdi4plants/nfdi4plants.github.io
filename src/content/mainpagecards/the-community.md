DataPlant is primarily geared towards the needs of fundamental plant research (e.g. those represented by the DFG categories 202-[01 evolution and systematics of plants and animals, 04 plant physiology, 05 plant biochemistry and biophysics, 06 plant cell and developmental biology, 07 plant genetics]. As such DataPlant is especially adapter to large scale data sets be it omics science or imaging and is ready to store petabaytes of annotated data.
