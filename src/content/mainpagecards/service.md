DataPLANT’s mission is service standing on the shoulders of giants. As such it relies on existing IT infrastructure and builds user-oriented services. DataPLANT wants to break the paradigm of “we are a --- mandated provider so you have to live with our tools where even IT experts get gray hair when submitting data” to “we understand that annotating data and providing metadata takes precious and we are in it together so let’s make this as easy as possible”.
