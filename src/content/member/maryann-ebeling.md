Wearing many hats is part of the fun at DataPLANT. I serve as the go-to support within our initiative, blending operational tasks—like upgrading our help desk infrastructure and coordinating projects—with active community building. I’m a passionate organizer who loves nothing more than being of service to researchers and promoting data literacy. For me, it’s not just about managing data; it’s about educating the community and ensuring our services truly empower the people behind the research.
