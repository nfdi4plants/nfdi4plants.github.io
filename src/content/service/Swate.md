Swate is an add-in that allows the user to easily annotate their data according to ISA standards. It focuses on providing an easy-to-use tool in the widely used and thus familiar environment of the most used spreadsheet editor. In order to directly incorporate collaborative mechanisms, the tool is implemented both as a modern web-based online application and as a desktop application. Fully integrated in Microsoft Excel, users can add and delete columns with specialized headers describing their data in a clear representation. By design, Swate facilitates ontology driven development of data annotation schemes by the domain experts performing the actual research data generation. Swate features a search function for ontological terms, facilitating an ontology-driven annotation of the data. It can insert ISA-conform protocols and processes that support the DataPLANT template mechanism.
