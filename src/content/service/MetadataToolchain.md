In respect to RDM, it seems natural to consider the data as the center and build the DataPLANT tool chain around it. This results in the technical realization and standardized RDM procedures being process-oriented, meaning that each tool realizes or supports the researcher in a distinct task within the RDM cycle. Consequently, this enables the desired mixed mode of application, in which both human and machine can operate processes simultaneously or asynchronously. In addition, we thereby avoid technological barriers and embrace open software and open science, respectively.
