To overcome annotation nuisance, DataPLANT provides a growing collection of templates designed and curated by data stewards that cover the submission routine to selected end-point repositories. The template design process is initiated “backwards”, starting from the requirements of end-point repositories and thereby compliance with metadata standards. 
Data stewards supervise the implementation of ontologies and the use of controlled vocabulary as required by the target repository, and simultaneously contribute to the development of the DataPLANT broker ontology.
