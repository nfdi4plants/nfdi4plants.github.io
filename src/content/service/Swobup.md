Experience has taught us that missing or unsuitable ontology terms and relations lead to a setback of user motivation and participation. DataPLANT provides a dedicated NFDI4plants ontology (to act as a broker and) bridge between the individual researcher and main ontology provider. This ontology enables the collection of missing vocabulary for immediate use and is also stored in the SwateDB. The automatic process handler Swobup (Swate OBO Updater) simplifies this ingestion process of adding or removing (one or more) terms from an ontology and synchronizes ontology terms in OBO format and publicly hosted metadata templates either by pull request mechanism or a group of authorized users. File versioning and adaptations to the database are outsourced to a shared repository. Any change can be reverted using the repositoryâ€™s built-in features.
