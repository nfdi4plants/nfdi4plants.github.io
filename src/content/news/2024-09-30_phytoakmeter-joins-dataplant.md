The DFG and SNF funded project PhytOakmeter (FOR 5571) joins forces with DataPLANT to make their research data FAIR - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed to formalize the common goal of establishing a data framework for plant research in compliance with the FAIR data principles and contributing to open science.
One main point of the cooperation is the implementation of the Annotated Research Context (ARC). It provides a scaffold to facilitate the creation and management of FAIR digital objects for plant researchers. PhytOakmeter will use the ARC structure for all centrally managed and relevant data generated. Furthermore, the PLANTdataHUB will be used as a collaborative research data management environment to facilitate collaboration, data exchange and upload to public repositories. DataPLANT will provide tool support by an onboarding workshop, instructions of Data Stewards and ongoing training and troubleshooting as required. The Data Stewards will have access to DataPLANT´s infrastructure and knowledge and will receive training and consulting. 
PhytOakmeter aims to understand acclimation and adaptation mechanisms in pedunculate oak (*Quercus robur* L.), with a focus on how microbial partners support this European forest tree in its response to environmental stresses. By using the in-vitro propagated *Q. robur* clone DF159, they will be able to study a holobiont, i.e. the tree with all its associated microbiota, while excluding genomic variation of the host tree. Various experimental platforms will be used to explore the phenotypic plasticity of clonal oak saplings under a range of environmental conditions, and to investigate how a change in conditions affect the plant and its holobiont partners. Ultimately, PhytOakmeter seeks to create a comprehensive model for forest evolutionary ecology, integrating -omics resources and diverse environmental stress experiments to enhance our understanding of tree responses to climate challenges. 
We are looking forward to this cooperation and advancing research data management in the plant  sciences!
