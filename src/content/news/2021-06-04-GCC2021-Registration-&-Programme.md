DataPLANT is deeply involved with Galaxy as a workflow system and thus would like to advertise the upcoming **Galaxy Community Conference**. The early registration deadline for the 2021 event has been moved back to **June 8**. This gives you more time to take advantage of the 50% discount off full registration prices, so make sure you [sign up now](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021-virtual-edition#attendees) so you don't miss out.

The [draft programme](https://gcc2021.sched.com/) and the speakers are now also available online. Please bear in mind that the times are set for the Europe/Middle East/Africa - Asia/Pacific window, and that the same schedule will run 9 hours later for the Americas. The availability of the speakers for the Q&A session will depend on the time zone in which they are located. [Posters and demo abstracts](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021-virtual-edition#abstracts) can still be submitted until the 14th of June. For any questions please contact our local liaison [Beatriz](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/hall-of-fame/beatrizserrano/).
