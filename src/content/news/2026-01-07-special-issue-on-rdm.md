The open access journal *Bausteine Forschungsdatenmanagement* has published a special issue on the topic of research data management and long-term archiving. The 
contributions in this issue relate concepts and practices from the research data management and long-term archiving communities to one another and formulate questions, 
recommendations, and insights aimed at strengthening the integration of both fields. The NFDI and its consortia are relevant actors fostering the various developments
both within their communities and overarching within the e.g. long-term archiving working group. The special issue is available under the following [DOI](https://doi.org/10.17192/bfdm.2025.3); 
the [editorial provides an overview of the contributions](https://bausteine-fdm.de/article/view/8964/8631).

DataPLANT contributes the article [“A software-centered approach to the long-term archiving of research data: Software preservation and emulation as safeguards for 
the long-term usability of data”](https://doi.org/10.17192/bfdm.2025.3.8854). The article highlights the relevance of software for the use of research data, particularly when 
software is required for the creation and presentation of the data. In the context of long-term archiving, the long-term availability and usability of the software itself 
therefore pose a challenge. The authors recommend the structured collection of software relevant to research data, documentation of knowledge on its use, emulation solutions, 
and legally compliant procedures for proprietary software. They advocate addressing these issues within the NFDI.
