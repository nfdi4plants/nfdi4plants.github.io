**RPTU Summer School on Fundamentals of Research Data Management**  
*July 17th to 21th, 2023*

Are you a PhD student, PostDoc or project PI pursuing data-driven research? Does your daily work involve collecting, organizing, publishing research data sets, small or large? Are you interested in learning about new concepts, principles, tools, and best practices that can make these activities more efficient and improve the quality of your data sets? Or are you interested in understanding these fundamentals to be able to formulate data management plans for research proposals? Or would you simply like to enhance your personal profile with new skills in research data management?

In either case, we cordially invite you to join our week-long summer school to enhance your skills in managing research data. In our interactive and hands-on training, you will learn how to effectively collect, store, organize, and share data. You will also learn about the latest technologies and tools to help you make the most of your research data.

The  
**RPTU Summer School on Fundamentals of Research Data Management**  
will take place in the week from  
**July 17th to 21th**  

and will include a mix of lectures, workshops, and hands-on exercises. You can expect to learn from experts in the field and connect with colleagues from various disciplines. A preliminary program will be made available to registered participants in the very near future. The number of participants is limited on account of the space available, thus we kindly ask you to register at your earliest convenience but no later than **May 31, 2023** via [this](https://forms.office.com/e/SpERRjQGSv) form.


We will send you further information in early June.
The summer school is an on-site, in presence event held at the [RPTU](https://rptu.de/). (In well justified exceptional cases, we will facilitate remote participation.)  
We hope you will join us in improving your knowledge in research data management, and look forward to welcoming you to our summer school!
