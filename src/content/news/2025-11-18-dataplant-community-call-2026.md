DataPLANT is pleased to announce the launch of our new Community Call, designed to support the plant science community in strengthening FAIR data practices. The call offers two complementary funding lines:

- **DataSteward Support** – Support through Data Stewards who provide expert guidance and help curate research data and workflows in alignment with FAIR principles. Projects may also request funding to integrate community members as Data Stewards within their own groups, working in close collaboration with DataPLANT.

- **Project Call** – Funding for activities such as tool development, workflow integration, community events, or training materials that contribute to a more FAIR and interoperable data landscape.

Applications can be submitted from now on. The submission deadline is 15 January 2026. All details regarding scope, requirements, and funding opportunities can be found here:

We invite all interested researchers, groups, and institutions to participate and collaborate with us in advancing FAIR research data management within plant science.

For questions, the Community Call team is available through <a href="mailto:&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;&#x6d;&#x75;&#x6e;&#x69;&#x74;&#x79;&#x63;&#x61;&#x6c;&#x6c;&#x40;&#x6e;&#x66;&#x64;&#x69;&#x34;&#x70;&#x6c;&#x61;&#x6e;&#x74;&#x73;&#x2e;&#x6f;&#x72;&#x67;?subject=DataPLANT%20Community%20Call%202026%20%E2%80%93%20Application">
