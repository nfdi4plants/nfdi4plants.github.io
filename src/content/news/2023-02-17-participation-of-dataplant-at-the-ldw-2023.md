This year's [Love Data Week](https://forschungsdaten.info/fdm-im-deutschsprachigen-raum/love-data-week/) was attended by several NFDI consortia, which given the cutting-edge topic "Data: Agent of Change," is not surprising.  
Together with the NFDI consortia [NFDI4Microbiota](https://nfdi4microbiota.de/), [NFDI4Health](https://www.nfdi4health.de/) and [NFDI4Biodiversity](https://www.nfdi4biodiversity.org/de/), a panel discussion entitled "Wind of change - sharing is caring! How to improve research data and its benefits in the life sciences." was held at the [University of Bremen](https://www.uni-bremen.de/).  
Making data-driven decisions in the life sciences has a huge effect on the well-being of people and the environment, as well as on the development of the future perspective and direction of research. Therefore, experts from different areas of the life sciences discussed the importance of data-driven decisions using best practice examples. Panelists were [Prof. Dr. Konrad Förstner](https://www.zbmed.de/kontakt/konrad-foerstner/) (NFDI4Microbiota), [Dr. Barbara Ebert](https://de.linkedin.com/in/barbaraebert/en) (NFDI4Biodiversity), [Prof. Dr. Dagmar Waltemath](https://www.fis.med.uni-greifswald.de/FIS/init_person_browser.action?pers_id=ngpocpv7uc2ss) (NFDI4Health) and [Prof. Dr. Björn Usadel](https://www.fz-juelich.de/profile/usadel_b) from our side. There was a thorough discussion on the challenges and benefits of cultural change related to research data management, Open Science and FAIR principles, and their impact on everyone's daily life.
