Our manager Cristina Martins Rodrigues, herself formerly part of the working group, took the opportunity of having a new large data set to present the FAIR principles and the relevance of research data management to the [Plant Physiology Department](https://www.bio.uni-kl.de/pflanzenphysiologie "Plant Physiology Department") at the [TU kaiserslautern](https://www.uni-kl.de/ "TU Kaiserslautern"). Subsequently, the audience was given a Quickstart on how to use the tools developed in DataPLANT to familiarize themselves with the topic using their own data as an example. A further meeting has already taken place, in which bottle necks were identified together. In addition, further questions could be clarified in this round. 
The Quickstart as well as further instructions for the use of the tools will be available on our website as soon as all apparent ambiguities have been clarified.
