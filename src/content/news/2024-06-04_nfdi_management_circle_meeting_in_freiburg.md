On June 4-5 the NFDI Management circle met in Freiburg. We discussed workflows and collaborations within the NFDI as well as between and within our consortia. NFDIMatwerk organized the event. DataPLANT was involved in a slot about the DFG data sheet. We used [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/de-DE) to get feedback from our fellow coordinators on the dos and donts of collecting feedback from partner institutions.
