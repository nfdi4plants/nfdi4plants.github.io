Some research areas in the scope of the DataPLANT also touch the topic of sensible data. The compute centres at the universities in Freiburg and Tübingen therefor implemented a management system for information security for their de.NBI Cloud infrastructures including its certification. These infrastructures also serve DataPLANT and all of its services. The complex and tedious certification process requires the commitment of various stakeholders. Fortunately, the BMBF allowed through the de.NBI project for a two-year grant to pursue an ISO27001 certification. The final certificate will be awarded in January 2022. The certification process is a long-term commitment which has to be repeated in regular intervals. A certified infrastructure will help researchers in DataPLANT and beyond to pursue research projects dealing with sensible data.
