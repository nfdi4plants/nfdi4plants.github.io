Once a year [fdm.nrw](https://www.fdm.nrw) invites data stewards, developers and users to the FDM-Werkstatt, a community-driven workshop and interactive environment to experiment with various RDM tools, software and code. Participants can test ideas, identify challenges and develop solutions collaboratively. DataPLANT joins [NFDI4BIOIMAGE](https://nfdi4bioimage.de/) and [CEPLAS](https://www.ceplas.eu/en/) as organizing partners for the 2026 event held from March 23rd to 25th, 2026, at Heinrich-Heine-University, Düsseldorf.
