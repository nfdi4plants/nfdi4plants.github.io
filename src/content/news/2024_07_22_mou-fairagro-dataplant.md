FAIRagro and DataPLANT have formalised their collaboration by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). This partnership aims to address critical needs in the agrosystem and plant research community by fostering joint activities and facilitating seamless interaction between the two consortia.
The collaboration focuses on several key objectives:

- implementing the [FAIR data principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) within the plant and agrosystems research community
- continous development of the Annotated Research Context ([ARC](https://arc-rdm.org/)) to establish them as a unified entry point for FAIRification
- connecting and supporting existing community-relevant services
- establishment of further joint use cases and show cases
- embedding data stewards for long term support, connection and sustainability of research data management activities
- workshops, meetings and helpdesks for personal community support

By combining their resources and expertise, FAIRagro and DataPLANT are committed to improving the toolset, providing a gateway to bundle efforts and facilitating data management in agrosystem and plant research.
This initiative will enhance the scientific use of personal health data, ultimately leading to improved population health.
