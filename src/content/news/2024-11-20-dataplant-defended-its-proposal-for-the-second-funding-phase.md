Today, DataPLANT presented in Bonn together with BioDiversity for the oral review of the second round funding application within the
National Research Infrastructure. The event consisted of individual presentation and questioning sessions of both consortia in the
morning, followed by a joint poster session after lunch. The presentation highlighted the major achievements in DataPLANT over the
past four years. It introduced a slightly modified governance structure, emphasizing key focus areas, and outlined the consortium's
future developments. Additionally, it presented DataPLANT's sustainability strategy, centering around the open collaboration and
contribution model. During the poster session, some practical aspects of the ARC, workflows on the PLANTdataHUB and especially the 
ARCitect were demonstrated. The time was tightly scheduled, and the exchange was intensive. We are looking forward to receive the 
reviewers further questions at January 15th, 2025.
