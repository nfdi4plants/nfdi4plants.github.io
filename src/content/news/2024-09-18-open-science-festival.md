The 3rd [Open Science Festival](https://converia.uni-mainz.de/frontend/index.php?sub=153) Germany took place at the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz from September 17-18, 2024 under the motto Meet, Share, Inspire, Care. It was aimed equally at newcomers, interested parties and experts with the aim to facilitate encounters and dialogue in a wide variety of formats. 

DataPLANT is committed to Open Science and actively participated with a market booth. Together with other NFDI consortia (namely Base4NFDI; DAPHNE4NFDI; NFDI4Biodiversity; NFDI4BIOIMAGE; NFDI4Culture; NFDI4Memory; NFDI4Objects; KonsortSWD; PUNCH4NFDI; Text+ and NFDI4Chem) "The German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) - data as a common good for excellent research, organised by the scientific community" was presented.

During a captivating panel discussion the participants debated how open science could advance artificial intelligence. Workshops with active participation were furthermore fostering exchange about open science, but also topics like error culture and the complexity of crediting in open science. We are already looking forward to the next time.
