From the very beginning, the National Infrastructure has been dedicated to the common topics spanning all consortia. At the beginning, common [cross-cutting topics were agreed upon in a meeting in Berlin](http://www.zenodo.org/record/3457213). Subsequently, based on this, four [sections](https://www.nfdi.de/sektionen/) were established by the Scientific Senate on 1.10.2021. The following sections have been launched:  
* Common Infrastructures (*section-infra*).  
* Ethical, Legal and Social Aspects (*section-ELSA*)  
* (Meta)data Terminologies and Provenance (*section-metadata*)  
* Training & Education (*section-edutrain*)  

Subsequently, the DFG published a [call for proposals](https://www.dfg.de/foerderung/info_wissenschaft/2022/info_wissenschaft_22_08/), which is intended to promote so-called basic services. After a [statement]( https://zenodo.org/record/6091657#.YgvDYt8xmUm) of the consortium assembly of the Association of the National Research Data Infrastructure on basic services, the call for proposals was adapted accordingly and could thus be taken as a motivation to write an application under the heading **Base4NFDI** by a union of the consortia. And indeed, the application was completed and submitted to the DFG on April 29, 2022. The [Letter of Intent](https://www.dfg.de/download/pdf/foerderung/programme/nfdi/absichtserklaerungen_2022/2022_base4_nfdi.pdf) shows all represented partners. And of course we from DataPLANT are part of it!  
We are looking forward to a fruitful collaboration in the sections and hope that the engagement we observe there will also be reflected in Base4NFDI in the future.
