Exchange of ideas on how to integrate [NFDI (National Research Data Infrastructure)](https://www.nfdi.de/) and enhance Research Data Management (RDM) services at local institutions becomes a topic of rising importance not only for DataPLANT and [NFDI4BIOIMAGE](https://nfdi4bioimage.de/en/start/). Addressing the challenge of spreading the NFDI concept across large research institutions with diverse involvement in the different subject and method specific consortia is crucial. Grant proposals of upcoming research projects should tailor their approach towards RDM by considering discipline-specific NFDI consortia. Additionally, it is essential to empower infrastructure providers, enabling them to comprehend and seamlessly integrate NFDI services at the local level. Here, the [Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf](https://www.hhu.de/) has taken a proactive step by establishing RDM representatives for each faculty, a model that is currently still to be implemented at the [Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg](https://uni-freiburg.de/).   

To foster a cohesive understanding of the NFDI's role among local stakeholders, implementing measures for synchronization has been identified as a key initiative. Additionally, collaborative efforts are underway to develop strategy papers aimed at advancing sustainability concepts within individual consortia and the broader NFDI framework.   

A consensus has been reached to collaborate on joint initiatives such as establishing helpdesks and engaging in collective developments in Virtual Desktop Infrastructures (VDI). These cooperative endeavors aim to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of NFDI implementation, ensuring a unified and strategic approach toward broad community support in sustainable RDM practices.
