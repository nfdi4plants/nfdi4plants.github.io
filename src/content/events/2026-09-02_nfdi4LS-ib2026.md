## Contents
For the first time, DataPLANT hosts the NFDI4LifeScience Annual Conference in conjunction with the International Symposium on Integrative Bioinformatics from 2–4 September 2026 at the Leibniz IPK in Gatersleben.

This joint event recognizes that the future of life sciences relies on a seamless connection between robust research data infrastructure and advanced analytical application. We bring together communities from Research Data Management (RDM) and Integrative Bioinformatics to explore how standardized, high-quality data fosters the next generation of bioinformatics research incorporating AI-driven methods.

See the full programme and registration on the conference website: https://meetings.ipk-gatersleben.de/nfdi4LS-IB2026/

## Thematic Focus

- The Foundation: Research Data Management
  - Infrastructure & Services: Building the backbone for reproducible science.
  - Data Stewardship: Curation, quality assurance, and metadata enrichment.
  - Best Practices: Establishing standards that work in practice, not just theory.

- The Application: Integrative Bioinformatics & AI
  - AI Readiness: Preparing data for machine learning and advanced modeling.
  - Integrative Approaches: Combining omics, phenomics and systems biology.
  - Applied AI: Case studies in crop science, plant genetics, and general life sciences.

- The Bridge: Training & Community
  - Capacity Building: Upskilling researchers in RDM and computational tools.
  - Community Exchange: Fostering collaboration between infrastructure providers and data users.
