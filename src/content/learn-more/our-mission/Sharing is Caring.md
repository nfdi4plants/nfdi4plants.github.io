Collaborative research and generation of comprehensive datasets is only possible through data sharing. Therefore, we envision a platform where data can be stored and jointly used prior to submission of the final data construct to an endpoint repository. This allows both the measurement service provider and a data steward, and at the same time a wet lab scientist, to add and logically connect their data to existing sets. Git's versioning capability allows each step to be tracked at any time, preserving the provenance of each dataset.
