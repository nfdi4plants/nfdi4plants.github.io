As a starting point, the ArcCommander simplifies the generation of the ARC folder and file structure. Following the ISA model, this includes a central registry in the form of an automatically updated investigation file. 
Although the requirements are minimal, assisting the researcher in these repetitive tasks and providing structured guidance is beneficial and reduces friction and workload on the side of the user. This is the main aim of the tool ArcCommander. Essentially, this tool provides automation and assistance with processes following the ARC specification. The ArcCommander can be executed to initialize an ARC, creating the basic folder structure, and setting the working environment. Additionally, it can be used to create and modify sub-branches of the ARC, such as assays and workflows.
