Assays correspond to outcomes of experimental assays or analytical measurements and are treated as immutable data. Each assay is a collection of files stored in a single directory, including a mandatory metadata file in ISA-XLSX format.

Assay data files, as well as protocols, must be placed in a subdirectory individually. 

We advise you to use SWATE for completing the study and assay metadata files, as it assists you in following the [annotation principles](http://www.nfdi4plants.de/AnnotationPrinciples/ "Annotation Principles") and comes along with a broad range of prepared templates.
