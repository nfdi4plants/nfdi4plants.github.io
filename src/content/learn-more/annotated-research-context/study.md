Studies are collections of material and resources used within the investigation.
You need to place each study in a unique subdirectory. Material or experimental samples, as well as external data files, can be stored as virtual sample files (containing unique identifiers) in the resources directory. To describe the sample or material creation process, you can store protocols in the designated sub-folder.

For each study, an isa.study.xlsx file following the ISA study model needs to be present to specify the characteristics of all material and resources, such as a certain strain. Resources might include external data (e.g., knowledge files or result files) that need to be included and cannot be referenced due to external limitations. Resources described in a study file can be the input for one or multiple assays.
