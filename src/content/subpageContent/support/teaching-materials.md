We offer frequent trainings by our Data Stewards to bring different scientific groups on board with DataPLANT’s concepts and tools as well as keep them up to date.
The materials used for teaching are openly shared in our knowledge base and can be useful whether you participated in a training or are looking for an introduction to our tools independently.

You can explore them [here](https://nfdi4plants.org/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/docs/teaching-materials/index.html).
