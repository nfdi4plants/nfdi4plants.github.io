The ARC is the central framework for research data management in DataPLANT.
ARCs are fair digital objects, that follow the RO Crate and ISA standard and package all research data and metadata related to your investigation.
Their folder structure comprises studies, assays, workflows and runs, as well as subfolders for protocols and raw data.
By default, ARCs also contain metadata files that follow the ISA standard.
To facilitate and partly automate the creation of ARCs two tools were developed: The ARCCommander is a command line-based tool for ARC creation, whereas ARCitect employs a graphical user interface for ARC creation and also integrates the annotation tool Swate.

ARCCommander and ARCitect also allow you to track all commits and push your ARC to the PLANTdataHUB for versioning, storage and sharing with collaborators or the whole scientific community.

To read more about ARCs, check out our [ARC website](arc-rdm.org).

If you want to start creating your ARC, you can find detailed guides for the [ARCCommander](https://nfdi4plants.org/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/docs/ArcCommanderManual/index.html) and [ARCitect](https://nfdi4plants.org/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/docs/ARCitect-Manual/index.html) in the knowledgebase.
