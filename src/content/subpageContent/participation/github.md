DataPLANT's work is openly accessible on GitHub.
Whether you are interested in more information on tools like the ARCitect or Swate, in the DataPLANT ontology collection, the ARC specification or Knowledge Base, you can find the respective GitHub repositories collected under the [DataPLANT GitHub organization nfdi4plants](https://github.com/nfdi4plants).

In these GitHub repositories, you can on the one hand track what is currently being worked on and see new tool releases.
On the other hand, if you run into any problems while using our tools, the respective GitHub repository can be used to open an issue and report a bug or read through issues that are already being discussed and worked on.
You can also use issues to request a new feature for tools or make other suggestions for improvements.

The GitHub repositories are also used to welcome contributions to the DataPLANT Biology Ontology and to the Swate template collection.
