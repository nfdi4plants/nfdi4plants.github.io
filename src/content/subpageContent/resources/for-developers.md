Developers can actively contribute to the development of DataPLANT tools by collaborating on various projects hosted on our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/nfdi4plants).
Whether you're interested in improving existing features, fixing bugs, or creating new functionalities, there are multiple ways to get involved:

- Fork and Clone: Start by forking the relevant repository and cloning it to your local environment.
This allows you to work on the code independently before submitting any changes.

- Issue Tracking: Check the open issues on GitHub to identify areas where help is needed, such as bug fixes or new features.
You can also submit new issues if you discover bugs or suggest enhancements.

- Pull Requests: After making improvements or developing new features, submit a pull request for review.
Our team will evaluate the changes and work with you to ensure they align with the project goals.

- Documentation: Contributions aren't limited to code—improving the documentation is also valuable.
Help by writing or refining tutorials, adding user guides, or enhancing API documentation to make our tools more accessible to the community.

- Testing: Participate in testing new features and providing feedback.
Ensuring that all tools are robust and perform well in different environments is key to maintaining high-quality software.

- Community Engagement: Join discussions on our GitHub community boards or other forums to share ideas, offer feedback, or ask for guidance.
Collaboration is at the heart of DataPLANT’s development.
