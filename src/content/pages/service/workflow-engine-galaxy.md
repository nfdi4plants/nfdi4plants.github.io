The Galaxy workflow system allows you to analyze your data from you ARCs by executing a series of tools and dataset operations in a defined sequence as a batch process. 
This powerful feature streamlines repetitive tasks and ensures consistency across your analyses. 
You can easily create workflows from analyses you’ve already performed by capturing them from your history or build entirely new workflows from scratch using the intuitive workflow editor. 
Galaxy workflows are highly flexible and versatile. 
You can annotate each step, providing documentation and context for future users or collaborators. 
Workflows can also be viewed and shared with colleagues, published for the broader community, or imported into your workspace for further customization. 
Like other objects within Galaxy, workflows are treated as first-class citizens, enabling you to manage them just as you would with datasets or other analysis outputs. 
Additionally, any workflow that you have permission to import can be modified using the workflow editor. 
This allows you to tailor existing workflows to your specific needs, making Galaxy an adaptable platform for both standard and custom analysis pipelines. 
Whether you're working on routine tasks or complex, multi-step processes, the Galaxy workflow system offers a robust solution for efficiently managing and automating your analyses. (Link zu Galaxy Plants: https://plants.usegalaxy.eu/).
