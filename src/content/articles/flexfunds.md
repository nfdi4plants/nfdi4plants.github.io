All DataPLANT services, tools and infrastructures are freely accessible to anyone that is interested in using them.
All tools can be downloaded on [GitHub](https://github.com/nfdi4plants) or are available as browser versions (e.g. [Swate](https://swate-alpha.nfdi4plants.org)) and guides can be found in the [Knowledge Base](https://nfdi4plants.org/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/index.html).
To use all functionalities related to your FAIR digital research object, the Annotated Research Context (ARC), creating a free DataPLANT account will be useful.
This will allow you to upload and continuously synchronize your ARC with the PLANTdataHUB, share it with collaborators and access or contribute to ARCs of collaborators that are not public.

To create a DataPLANT account you can follow [this link](https://register.nfdi4plants.org).
