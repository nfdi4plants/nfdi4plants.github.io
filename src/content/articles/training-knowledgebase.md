DataPLANT’s teaching and training services ensure smooth adoption and effective use of its tools in the research community. 
All services are containerized for easy deployment and access. 
In collaboration with NFDI4BIOIMAGE, DataPLANT developed a comprehensive remote training environment, offering researchers an interactive, hands-on experience. 
The Galaxy training infrastructure supports training sessions and structured learning paths for users. 
The website offers a self-study knowledge base with cookbooks, RDM tutorials, ARC guides, and detailed tool documentation. 
For community support, DataPLANT provides a helpdesk and a Git-based project exchange on GitHub, fostering international collaboration. 
This platform enables project planning and offers a space for researchers to share experiences, seek advice, and collaborate. 
DataPLANT also organizes community events, including onboarding sessions, consortium meetings, summer schools, lectures, practical courses, and hackathons together with Data Stewards to encourage knowledge sharing and engagement.
