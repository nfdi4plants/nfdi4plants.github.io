DataPLANT offers several tools to facilitate RDM.
To help you make the most of these tools we offer detailed, step by step guides and examples in our knowledgebase.
Here you can find guides for creating and managing ARCs with the ARCCommander, ARCitect or ARCmanager, creating metadata annotation tables with Swate and sharing your data on the DataHUB.

Explore our [knowledge base](https://nfdi4plants.org/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/index.html) to find manuals for tools but also guides for e.g. contributing to ontologies and applying metadata standards.
