DataPLANT will participate in the [3rd NFDI conference](https://www.dfg.de/foerderung/info_wissenschaft/2021/info_wissenschaft_21_38/index.html), held virtually on the **8th July**. The [National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI)](https://www.nfdi.de/) is being established as a cooperative network of consortia over a three-year period (2019-2021) in three stages. DataPLANT was already successful in the first round. As part of the third round of calls, the third NFDI conference will be held in a virtual format on July 8, 2021.

This conference has three objectives:

1. The consortia funded or proposed for funding and the planned consortia will be able to exchange information with each other, focusing primarily on the planned consortia.
2. The DFG would like to inform the representatives of planned consortia about the status of the NFDI and the key points for the submission of proposals in the third and, for the time being, final round.
3. The NFDI Directorate and in particular its director, Professor Dr. York Sure-Vetter, will also be represented to present the further activities of the NFDI Association, which has been founded in the meantime.

Due to the important networking aspect, DataPLANT will participate as a funded consortium to play a role in providing collegial advice to the new applicants as well as in discussing cross-consortium issues.
