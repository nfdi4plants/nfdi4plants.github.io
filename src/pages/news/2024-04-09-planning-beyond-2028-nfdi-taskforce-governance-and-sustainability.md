Starting for the follow up grant application of the DataPLANT consortium we are joining forces with other consortia to shape the future vision and development of the NFDI. On the 9th April the second online meeting of the Taskforce Governance and Sustainability was held.

DataPLANT is becoming actively involved in the Taskforce Governance and Sustainability of the NFDI. The taskforce is currently working on formulating a joint position paper that outlines how the NFDI should evolve from the perspective of the consortia after 2028. Additionally, we are aiming to establish a second federal-state agreement, and this position paper will play a crucial role in the structural evaluation and political processes.

In terms of the task force's composition, we are ensuring the involvement of the NFDI office, ideally with them taking responsibility for the task force. We are also making efforts to ensure that all consortia are represented or informed about the task force meetings. We plan to send a proposal email to the spokesperson group to encourage participation in the task force discussions.

Furthermore, the position paper will reference other key documents, such as the NFDI Strategy and the first federal-state agreement. We intend to cluster prioritized topics in a separate document, possibly within the position paper itself. We aim to leverage our accumulated experiences as our asset, framing them as an interim assessment. We encourage courage in thinking differently and avoiding a sole focus on existing structures or minor changes. Instead, we seek to develop a long-term perspective.
