At the following NFDI talk on March 1, 4 p.m., the speaker of DataPLANT will give a presentation on the current state of the discussion on "Community Pervasion and Sustainability". This contribution addresses the cross-cutting topic of further NFDI development and integrates key aspects discussed since the beginning of the project in September 2020, such as in the speaker jour fix, the exchange with the DFG in mid-January 2021 and the NFDI directorate in February.

One of the main goals of each consortium and the entire NFDI is to expand community engagement and to outreach into each respective scientific communities. How is it possible for the NFDI to involve previously disregarded members of the community and how do the methods used to achieve this goal impact the third round of the NFDI formation process? Furthermore, sustainable funding considerations of the consortia/the entire NFDI will be presented, aiming at a redesinged workflow for grant applications of new projects and research clusters. This could help to anchor the NFDI sustainably in the individual research communities and to foster standardization, use of data management plans and the implementation of FAIR principles.

We are looking forward to the event and hope for a lively discussion.
