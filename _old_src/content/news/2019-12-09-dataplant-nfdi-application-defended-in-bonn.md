DataPLANT was initiated by BioDATEN in Baden-Wuerttemberg and DaPLUS of  Kaiserslautern and Jülich to create a NFDI consortium on fundamental plant  research. It took part in the next round together with other consortia like  NFDI4AGRI, NFDI4Earth and NFDI4BioDiversity.

On the 2nd and 3rd of December 2019 the DataPLANT consortium has been in Bonn and presented and defended the NFDI application. The perceived feedback on the first day was quite positive. On the second day, we received in a further individual round a couple of more detailed questions on certain aspects. We are optimistic that we left a solid impression, whereby a general assessment and classification is difficult at this stage of the overall procedure. DataPLANT is a comparably small consortium compared to other larger ones. In January 2020, we expect a written statement, to which we can react again with a three-page comment. On this basis, the reviewers will make a recommendation by the end of May 2020. The formal decision will probably be made at the end of July 2020.
