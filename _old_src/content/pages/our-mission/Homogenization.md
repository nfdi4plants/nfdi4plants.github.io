The advantages of a well-maintained research data management according to FAIR principles are obvious. In this context, especially the annotation of metadata is essential. The completeness of these depends on the corresponding endpoint repository and is based on specific formats, checklists and terminologies. For individual researchers, the amount of different standards can easily become unmanageable. Therefore, we have made it our mission to keep track of the key data relevant for data publication by including them in our Annotated Research Context, enabling the individual researcher to comfortably use the prefabricated construct without having to worry about such trivialities.
