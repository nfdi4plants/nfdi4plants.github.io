The [**A**nnotated **R**esearch **C**ontext (ARC)](https://nfdi4plants.github.io/arc-website/) is DataPLANT's central concept for organizing and documenting research data, focal point of collaboration, data exchange, and overall FAIR Digital Object of choice.

When using the DataPLANT tools (e.g. [ARCitect](https://nfdi4plants.org/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/docs/ARCitect-Manual/index.html]) and [guides](https://nfdi4plants.org/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/index.html) to create ARCs, the majority of ARC guidelines will be followed automatically.

The detailed description of these technical requirements are captured in the **ARC specification**.
However, the **ARC is not a top-down mandated concept**, but rather a community-driven effort.
The ARC specification is a living document that is continuously improved and extended upon.
It is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARC-specification) and open for contributions from the community, as well as [general discussions](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARC-specification/discussions).

The same is true for all ARC-related tooling developed by DataPLANT: development is done out in the open on our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/nfdi4plants), which also has an [top-level discussion forum](https://github.com/orgs/nfdi4plants/discussions).
For the core ARC tools, we even have an [open development board](https://github.com/orgs/nfdi4plants/projects/10/views/2), which gives an overview on the entire development process of our core developer team.
