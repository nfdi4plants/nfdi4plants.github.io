Our spreadsheet-based tool Swate helps you to create annotation tables by adding different building blocks to represent your experimental process, while following the ISA schema and using ontology terms.
In Swate, different templates are already available that combine building blocks into commonly used protocols or that represent metadata requirements of endpoint repositories or minimum information standards.
Both, DataPLANT-curated templates, that have been created by our Data Stewards, and also community-contributed templates are available.

If there is no template representing your metadata requirements, you can contribute a template of your typical experimental assay to Swate so that other scientists from inside or outside your project can reuse it.

You can create the template using the online version of [Swate](https://swate-alpha.nfdi4plants.org/) and add tags for it to be easily findable.
The addition to our Swate database that makes it available in the tool occurs via a pull request on GitHub.

A detailed guide for creating and contributing templates you can find in the [Knowledge Base](https://nfdi4plants.org/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/docs/guides/swate_template-contribution.html).
You can find here the respective [GitHub repo here](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/Swate-templates).
